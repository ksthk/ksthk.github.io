Today I was a guest on the Cryptocast, a podcast primarily on Bitcoin by Dutch radio station BNR Newsradio. Regularly episodes are recorded in the BNR studios, but this one ran remotely due to the social distancing measures currently in force to tackle COVID-19.

During the show we go over some TA (technical analysis) on the current Bitcoin price, this week's crypto news, such as Binance's M&A of Coinmarketcap and go into some of the nitty gritty of my recent research paper, which is available for download [here](hacks.pdf).

You can listen to the podcast via regular podcatchers such as Apple Podcasts or stream the audio from [BNR's website](https://www.bnr.nl/podcast/cryptocast/10406648/cryptobeurzen-worden-veiliger-maar-het-kan-veel-beter). This one has the best audio quality. It is also on YouTube, which includes the Zoom gallery view and some screenshares, but worse audio:
